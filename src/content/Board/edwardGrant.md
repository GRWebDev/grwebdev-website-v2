Edward loves the craft of code. Not just the ones and zeros, but the process, the tools, and solving problems. If you
have a problem that needs solving, he'll be the first one to tell you to use the thing getting a glow-up today instead
of the thing you were planning to use. He is always railing against his coworkers who seem stuck in time, but never
getting that API key for AI that his employer is paying for.
